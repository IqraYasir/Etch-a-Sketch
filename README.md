# Etch-a-Sketch
This project is a test of previous javascript skills I have learnt, namely DOM manipulation. Hopefully it goes well.

EDIT: I am very happy with the end product. Unlike with the rock, paper, scissors project, I actually knew what I was doing, I improved, and I knew what more I could do to this project to make it even better.
